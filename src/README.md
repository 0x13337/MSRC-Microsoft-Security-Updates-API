# Sample Code

The sample code serves as an example on how to interact with the MSRC Security Updates API. Currently, the sample code consists of one PowerShell module, however more languages may be provided in the future. In the PowerShell module, you will see script functions that show how to interact with the API, as well as functions that organize data from the CVRF document to show some reporting scenarios.

The module can be installed from the PowerShell Gallery like this:

```PowerShell
#Must be run as Administrator
Install-Module MsrcSecurityUpdates
